                    <h1>LA Airspace</h1><br>
                    <p>LA Airspace was a project spanning 2013-2015 in which I documented the city of Los Angeles from a helicopter. Over the course of 30 flights the project canvassed the massive sprawl of the city; from San Pedro to as far north as Santa Clarita and Mt Baldy. Every flight occurred during sunset hours, which created a glamorized portrait of the city basking in long shadows.</p><br>
                    <p>While it is easy to describe as beautiful, Los Angeles has a tendency to be lost in translation when viewed from the ground.</p>

                    <h1>Life Cycles</h1><br>
                    <p>Life Cycles features the creation, use, and eventual destruction of aircraft.  Created from an aerial vantage point over numerous locations on the West Coast of the USA, Life Cycles reverses our usual perception of aviation: instead of photographing airplanes from the ground or from within, here they are photographed from above.</p><br>
                    <p>The majority of people have only been able to experience aviation through crowded concourses, cramped seating, and tiny windows.</p>

                    <h1>Pan Am Flies Again</h1><br>
                    <p>From its founding in the 1920s to its peak in the 1960s and 1970s, Pan Am set the status quo when it came to international travel. Everyone wanted to fly Pan Am, other airlines wanted to be Pan Am, and everyone wanted to work for Pan Am.  Revered by the rich and famous, the traveling public, enthusiasts and employees alike, Pan Am’s legacy lives on to this day.</p><br>
                    <p>In an attempt to share this legacy with the world, I worked with Anthony Toth, one of the world’s foremost experts on aviation history, to bring Pan Am back to life in 2014.</p>

                    <h1>Classified</h1><br>
                    <p>I was invited to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in August of 2018 to create images of NASA's current project, the Space Launch System, known colloquially as the SLS. The SLS program is intended to pick up where the Space Shuttle left off, ferrying cargo, satellites, and humans to the moon, Mars, and beyond.</p><br>
                    <p>NASA worked tirelessly to ensure open and free photographic access to the facility, and I was told it was possible to take photos of almost anything. Despite this, I censored a few things that I thought were better left secret.</p>

                    <h1>Airportraits</h1><br>
                    <p>Most photographs work to capture a single decisive moment. Each Airportrait is captured over an extended time period, anywhere from three hours to nearly sixteen hours. Using a stationary camera, every aircraft movement during the given time period is meticulously captured. The hundreds, sometimes thousands, of resulting images are then culled and each departing aircraft is cut, stitched, and assembled onto a background image taken during the same time period.</p><br>
                    <p>This process creates a temporally expanded composite image of the airport, showing a day's worth of air traffic and activity.</p>
